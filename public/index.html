  <div class="section">
    <p>Move beyond words and enter a space where connection is felt through movement and sound. MagneticSync is a shared journeyâ€”a digital playground where two people, whether close or across the world, can align in real time. </p>
    <p>Here, the goal is simple: let your cursor drift across the screen and feel the magnetic pull of another. When your paths meet, a yellow circle will appear, marking the instant of your connection. Let the rhythm guide you, as music flows only when your movements harmonize.</p>
    <p>Ready to connect?</p>
